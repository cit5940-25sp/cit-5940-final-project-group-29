# Movie Name Game

## Project Overview
This project implements a text-based multiplayer game inspired by [cine2nerdle](https://cine2nerdle.app/battle), where players name movies that are connected by shared actors, directors, writers, cinematographers, or composers.  
The game uses data from TMDB and enforces win conditions based on genres or years.
